Forms Validation App

This application was part of a course entitled React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux)
by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.


This is a simple validation form application.


To run this application, copy/paste files into VS or text editor.
Npm install.
Npm start.


This simple application is a form that verifies if the user enters their first name, last name, and a valid e-mail address.
When typing in one of the boxes, the box will start out as orange.
As the user begins to type, the box will change to purple color.
If the user skips a field or the e-mail is invalid, such as not having an "@" symbol, the box will turn red with an error message below instructing the user what needs to be added to the specified field.
Once all fields are verified they all turn purple and the "Submit" button turns to a dark prurple color.

Running the attached code You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it. To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first. Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder). Run npm start to pull up application on your computer. Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
